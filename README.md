# Walmart Sales Data Analysis and Prediction

This repository hosts a data science project focused on analyzing and predicting Walmart's sales data. Utilizing Python with libraries like **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization, and **scikit-learn** for machine learning, this project provides a thorough exploration of Walmart's sales across 45 stores. Key features of the project include:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Rigorous data preparation processes to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual and statistical analysis to uncover underlying patterns and trends in sales data.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Application of clustering techniques to segment stores into meaningful groups based on sales performance and external factors, facilitating targeted marketing and strategic planning.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Development and validation of a **Random Forest** model to forecast weekly sales, emphasizing model accuracy and generalizability.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Detailed evaluation of predictive models to assess their efficacy and reliability in real-world scenarios.

The project aims to enhance strategic decision-making at Walmart by providing detailed insights and predictions on sales trends, contributing to more informed and effective business strategies.
